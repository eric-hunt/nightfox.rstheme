<h1 align="center">Nightfox (for RStudio)</h1>

Special thanks to the creator(s) of this great *vim/neovim* theme ([Nightfox](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim))! I hope many others will now enjoy this great theme in the RStudio IDE.

This theme is implemented using the [`rsthemes`](https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes) package, which provides:

> :crystal_ball: Full RStudio IDE and Syntax Themes

The package not only provides an extensive set of themes to beautify your RStudio experience, but also provides tools to create your own themes.

I am indebted to the many contributors to this curated arsenal of harmonious colors that make staring at R code a much more pleasant experience. My goal is to submit this theme to be merged into the `rsthemes` package once I get most of the kinks worked out, but in the meantime, if you want to try it out you can install this R package from GitHub with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!require(rsthemes)) remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/rsthemes")
remotes::install_github("eric-hunt/nightfox.rstheme")
# Recursively install all styles of the theme:
purrr::walk(
  c("nightfox", "dawnfox", "dayfox", "duskfox", "nordfox", "terafox"),
  function(style) {
    nightfox_rstheme(style = style, apply = TRUE)
  }
)
# Or, alternatively, just install (and apply) what you want with:
nightfox_rstheme(style = "dawnfox", apply = TRUE)
```

Or, you can just download the pre-built .rstheme file(s) and import within RStudio:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A["Tools/"]-->B["Global Options/"]-->C["Appearance/"]-->D("Add...")
```
